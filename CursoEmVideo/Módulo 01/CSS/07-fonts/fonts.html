		About Barlow Condensed
		Barlow is a slightly rounded, low-contrast, grotesk type family. Drawing from the visual style of the California public, Barlow shares qualities with the state's car plates, highway signs, busses, and trains.

		This is the Condensed family, which is part of the superfamily along with Normal and Semi Condensed, each with 9 weights in Roman and Italic.

		The Barlow project is led by Jeremy Tribby, a designer based in San Francisco, USA. To contribute, see github.com/jpt/barlow

		Updated December 2018: Added Vietnamese.
